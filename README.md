Hello dear friends,

I created this app for a school project.
In this project, owner adds products to firebase with its barcode number and some features of product like name, ingredient
 etc. and user can type the barcode number or scan the barcode to see this features.

I used [this](https://github.com/journeyapps/zxing-android-embedded) library to scan barcodes, thanks to JourneyApps.
